- 👋 Hi, I’m @jjmurillo, lecturer at Universidad de Sevilla
- 👀 I’m interested in (every piece of knowledge, art, history,...) machine learning, artificial vision and digital communications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pytorch, violin, basic quantum ideas, better understanding information theory and focused on latent spaces for variational deep learning with application to artifical vision.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a python package for digital communications and creating a SDR lab with free HW/SW.
- 📫 How to reach me: you have my contact information at my web page (http://personal.us.es/murillo)
